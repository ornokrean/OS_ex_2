 Today we have many sites that act like apps (gmail, facebook), and we want to let the browser
 handle and manage all its running processes by itself, to enable efficient runtime and mobility.




We got the pid of 21123 and ran the kill command: "kill 21123".
using strace we learned that the only signal sent was:
kill(21123, SIGTERM) = 0
the trigger was hitting the enter key on the keyboard, and the operating system should handle them.
the command was sent through the shell.
